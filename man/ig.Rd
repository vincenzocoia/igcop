\arguments{
\item{u, v}{Vectors of values between 0 and 1 representing values of the first
and second copula variables.}

\item{theta}{Parameter of the IG copula family. Vectorized; >0.}

\item{alpha}{Parameter of the IG copula family. Vectorized; >0.}

\item{p}{Vector of quantile levels between 0 and 1
to evaluate a quantile function at.}

\item{mxiter}{Maximum number of iterations to run the Newton-Raphson
algorithm when computing inverse. Positive integer, default 20.}

\item{eps}{The Newton-Raphson algorithm for computing an inverse will
stop if the step size is less than this small number.}

\item{bd}{The largest acceptable step size in the Newton-Raphson
algorithm. Step size is reduced if it reaches this large.}

\item{n}{Positive integer. Number of observations to randomly draw.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length equal to the length of the input vector(s).
}
\description{
Functions related to the IG copula family, denoted  by \code{'ig'}.
}
\note{
Inputting two vectors greater than length 1 is allowed, if they're
the same length.
Also, \code{qcondig21} and \code{pcondig21} are the same as
\code{qcondig} and \code{pcondig} -- they're the distributions of
variable 2 given 1.
