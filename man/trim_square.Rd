\title{Trim values to (0, 1)}
\usage{
trim_square(u, eps = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{Vector of values.}

\item{eps}{Distance from 0 and 1 for which to truncate.}
}
\value{
The vector \code{u} with its values possibly truncated.
}
\description{
Values between 0 and 1 that are to close to either 0 or 1
are replaced with epsilon or 1-epsilon, respectively.
}
\note{
This function is used to trim copula inputs, and
is intended to be a temporary fix until functions like
igcop's in-house \code{qgamma} and inverse functions have their
accuracies improved.
