Description: Compute distributional quantities for an
    Integrated Gamma (IG) or Integrated Gamma Limit (IGL) copula, such
    as a cdf and density. Compute corresponding conditional quantities
    such as the cdf and quantiles. Generate
    data from an IG or IGL copula. See the vignette for formulas,
    or for a derivation, see Coia, V (2017) "Forecasting of Nonlinear 
    Extreme Quantiles Using Copula Models." PhD Dissertation, 
    The University of British Columbia.
