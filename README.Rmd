The goal of igcop is to provide tools for computing on the Integrated Gamma (IG) and Integrated Gamma Limit (IGL) copula families. 

## Installation

igcop is not yet available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), but can be downloaded from this repository using devtools. Just execute this line of code in an R instance, after ensuring you have the devtools R package installed:

``` r
devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/igcop")
```

## Definition

The IG copula family is defined by parameters $\theta > 0$ and $alpha > 0$, with the IGL copula family obtained with $\theta \rightarrow \infty$ (so, only has one parameter $alpha > 0$).

The IG and IGL copula families are unique in that they are not permutation symmetric. Also, the family of conditional distributions given the first variable has a non-constant extreme value index (EVI) across the first variable for the IG family, and is 0 for the IGL family. This means that, when used in a regression context, the conditional distribution of the response has an EVI that changes with the predictor for an IG copula, or reduces a heavy-tailed response to a light-tailed conditional distribution.

## Usage

This package piggybacks on the base R syntax for distributions, whose functions adopt the convention:

```
<prefix><name>
```

For IG and IGL copulas:

- `<prefix>` corresponds to one of:
    - `r` for random number generation (currently not supported for conditional distributions),
    - `p` for cdf, 
    - `d` for density, and 
    - `q` for quantile (for conditional distributions only).
- `<name>` corresponds to the possible names:
    - `ig` and `igl` correspond to an IG copula and IGL copula, respectively.
    - `condig12` and `condigl12` correspond to a conditional distribution of the first variable given the second, of an IG copula and IGL copula respectively. 
    - `condig21` and `condigl21` correspond to a conditional distribution of the second variable given the first, of an IG copula and IGL copula respectively (also available as `condig` and `condigl` to match the syntax of the [CopulaModel](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/CopulaModel) package).

All of these functions have a `cpar` argument expecting the value of the copula parameters. For an IG copula, this is `c(theta, alpha)`, and just `alpha` for an IGL copula.

Here are some examples, starting with evaluating the density of an IG copula at (0.3, 0.6):

```{r example}
library(igcop)
dig(0.3, 0.6, cpar = c(3, 2))
```

Computations are vectorized over both `u` and `v` (first and second variables). Here's the cdf and density of an IGL copula at different values:

```{r}
u <- seq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 9)
v <- seq(0.9, 0.5, length.out = 9)
pigl(u, v, cpar = 4)
digl(0.2, v, cpar = 4)
```

It doesn't make sense to talk about quantiles for a multivariate distribution, so this is only defined for conditional distributions. 

Here is an example of a distribution given the first variable ("2 given 1"). Note that the "2 given 1" distributions swap the `u` and `v` arguments to better align with the conditioning, and you can either explicitly include the `21` suffix or not.

```{r}
qcondig(v, u, cpar = c(5, 3))
qcondig21(v, u, cpar = c(5, 3))
```

Here is the corresponding "1 given 2" distribution. Since this is less common in regression scenarios, you have to explicitly add the `12` prefix for "1 given 2".

```{r}
qcondig12(v, u, cpar = c(5, 3))
```


Generating 5 values from an IG copula:

```{r}
rig(5, cpar = c(5, 4))
```
