The goal of igcop is to provide computational tools for the Integrated Gamma (IG) and Integrated Gamma Limit (IGL) copula families.

## Installation

igcop is not yet available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), but can be downloaded from this repository using devtools. Just execute this line of code in an R instance, after ensuring you have the devtools R package installed:

``` r
devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/igcop")
```

## Definition

The IG copula family is defined by parameters $\theta > 0$ and $\alpha > 0$, with the IGL copula family obtained with $\theta \rightarrow \infty$. So, the IGL copula family only has one parameter, $\alpha > 0$. For a detailed definition, see Coia [-@coia2017].

The IG and IGL copula families are unique in that they are not permutation symmetric. Also, when used in a regression context, the conditional distribution of the response (the 2nd copula variable) has an EVI that increases with the predictor for an IG copula, and reduces a heavy-tailed response to a light-tailed conditional distribution for an IGL copula.

## Usage

This package piggybacks on the base R syntax for distributions, such as `dnorm()` and `pexp()`, whose functions adopt the convention:

```
<prefix><name>
```

For IG and IGL copulas:

- `<prefix>` corresponds to one of:
    - `p` for cdf, 
    - `d` for density (and `logd` for log density),
    - `q` for quantile (for conditional distributions only), and
    - `r` for random number generation (not supported for conditional distributions).
- `<name>` corresponds to the possible names:
    - `ig` and `igl` correspond to an IG copula and IGL copula, respectively.
    - `condig12` and `condigl12` correspond to a conditional distribution of the first variable given the second, of an IG copula and IGL copula respectively. 
    - `condig21` and `condigl21` correspond to a conditional distribution of the second variable given the first, of an IG copula and IGL copula respectively (also available as `condig` and `condigl` to match the syntax of the [CopulaModel](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/CopulaModel) package).


Here are some examples, starting with evaluating the density of an IG copula at (0.3, 0.6):

```{r example}
library(igcop)
dig(0.3, 0.6, theta = 3, alpha = 2)
```

Computations are vectorized over both `u` and `v` (first and second variables), along with the parameter values. Here's the cdf and density of an IGL copula at different values:

```{r}
u <- seq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 9)
v <- seq(0.9, 0.5, length.out = 9)
pigl(u, v, alpha = 4)
digl(0.2, v, alpha = u)
```

It doesn't make sense to talk about quantiles for a multivariate distribution, so this is only defined for conditional distributions. 

Here is an example of a distribution given the first variable ("2 given 1"). Note that the "2 given 1" distributions swap the `u` and `v` arguments to better align with the conditioning, and you can either explicitly include the `21` suffix or not.

```{r}
qcondig(v, u, theta = 5, alpha = 3)
qcondig21(v, u, theta = 5, alpha = 3)
```

Here is the corresponding "1 given 2" distribution. Since this is less common in regression scenarios, you have to explicitly add the `12` prefix for "1 given 2".

```{r}
qcondig12(v, u, theta = 5, alpha = 3)
```


Generating 5 values from an IG copula:

```{r}
rig(5, theta = 5, alpha = 4)
```
