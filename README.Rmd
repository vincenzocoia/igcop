The goal of igcop is to provide tools for computing on the Integrated Gamma (IG) and Integrated Gamma Limit (IGL) copula families. 

**Currently under active development, and still developing a working version**

## Installation

igcop is not yet available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org), but can be downloaded from this repository using devtools. Just execute this line of code in an R instance, after ensuring you have the devtools R package installed:

``` r
devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/igcop")
```

## Definition

The IG copula family is defined by parameters $\theta > 0$ and $k > 1$, although computations are problematic for $k < 2$, although mostly just for $k$ close to 1. 

...

What makes the IG copula interesting is in regression analysis, where the response is the second variable. If the response is heavy-tailed, and is linked to a predictor via an IG copula, then its conditional distributions have lighter tails with a non-constant extreme value index across the predictor space. The IGL copula is interesting in a similar light, except its conditional distributions are all light-tailed (!) -- meaning that the predictor is solely responsible for the heavy tail of the response variable.

## Usage

This package piggybacks on the base R syntax for distributions, whose functions adopt the convention:

```
<prefix><name>
```

For IG and IGL copulas:

- `<prefix>` corresponds to one of:
    - `r` for random number generation (currently not supported for conditional distributions),
    - `p` for cdf, 
    - `d` for density, and 
    - `q` for quantile (for conditional distributions only).
- `<name>` corresponds to the possible names:
    - `igcop` and `iglcop` correspond to an IG copula and IGL copula, respectively.
    - `condigcop12` and `condiglcop12` correspond to a conditional distribution of the first variable given the second, of an IG copula and IGL copula respectively. 
    - `condigcop21` and `condiglcop21` correspond to a conditional distribution of the second variable given the first, of an IG copula and IGL copula respectively (also available as `condigcop` and `condiglcop` to match the syntax of the [CopulaModel](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/CopulaModel) package).

All of these functions have a `cpar` argument expecting the value of the copula parameters. For an IG copula, this is `c(theta, k)`, and just `k` for an IGL copula.

Here are some examples, starting with evaluating the density of an IG copula at (0.3, 0.6):

```{r example}
library(igcop)
# digcop(0.3, 0.6, cpar = c(3, 2))
```

Computations are vectorized over both `u` and `v` (first and second variables). Here's the cdf and density of an IGL copula at different values:

```{r}
# u <- seq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 9)
# v <- seq(0.9, 0.5, length.out = 9)
# piglcop(u, v, cpar = 4)
# diglcop(0.2, v, cpar = 4)
```

It doesn't make sense to talk about quantiles for a multivariate distribution, so this is only defined for conditional distributions. Note that the "2 given 1" distributions swap the `u` and `v` arguments to better align with the conditioning.

```{r}
# qcondigcop(v, u, cpar = c(5, 3))
```

Generating 5 values from an IG copula:

```{r}
# rigcop(5, cpar = c(5, 4))
```
